Key: (int, float, or varchar) given. Key itself.
Rid list: holds all RIDs that map to the specific key value


3. Page Format
- Show your internal-page (non-leaf node) design.

start || charIndicator | parentPageNum | freeSpaceOffset | 1st childPageNum | key | pagePointer | key | pagePointer | ... | pagePointer || end

charIndicator: (char: 1 byte) used to indicate if the page is the root page, internal page, or leaf page.
parentPageNum: (int: 4 bytes) used to store the page number of the parent of the current page
freeSpaceOffset: (int: 4 bytes) used to point to the start of the free space within the current page
1st childPageNum: (int: 4 bytes) used to point to the left most child of the current page

- Show your leaf-page (leaf node) design.
start || charIndicator | parentPageNum | leftPageNum | rightPageNum | freeSpaceOffset || end
charIndicator: (char: 1 byte) used to indicate if the page is the root page, internal page, or leaf page
parentPageNum: (int: 4 bytes) used to store the pageNumer of the parent of the current page
leftPageNum: (int: 4 bytes) used to point to the page immediately to the left of the current page
rightPageNum: (int: 4 bytes) used to point to the page immediately to the right of the current page
freeSpaceOffset: (int: 4 bytes) used to point to the start of the freeSpace within the current page
